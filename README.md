## My mother saw my engine, Jerry. My engine!

## Codenamed "Costanza" for extremely important reasons.

This engine will be used for our upcoming game, "Washington Unhinged 3D." However, upon completion of the aforementioned project, we will continue to renovate Constanza so that he may be useful for other projects.

## Specs:

1. For now, we will focus on developing a sector-based ray casting engine.
2. We will use SDL in tandem with GL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) for producing the graphics.
3. There will be robust audio output that allows for realistic sound physics.
4. We will not surpass a runtime analysis of n<sup>2</sup>.

##Reminder!

Prototype as much as you can with Evaldraw and Polydraw.

## To-Do:

1. Define the structure of the game project and assign tasks. (ALL)
2. Create a list of desired game features and then strip it down (INIT = Daniel -> all)
3. Finish setting up the repository. (Daniel/Cory)
4. Get SDL and GLEW running on all machines. (Daniel)
5. Craft a "Main.cpp" of sorts that houses a graphics window for rendering.

More to-do's to come!

## Feature List
See the design docs in the docs folder.
